The purpose of this code is to produce grain structures given a set of
parameters and a growth mode. Once these structures are produced, they will
be used to train a machine learned model to predict material processing conditions
based on microstructure. It will be trained on simulated images, and the goal
is to predict real life grain processing conditions.
